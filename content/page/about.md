I'm a cloud engineer pivoting into offensive security and red teaming.

This site is my working notebook for:

- AWS and Kubernetes attack labs
- CRTO preparation and notes
- Detection engineering and purple-team ideas

Posts are written as **attack → detection → mitigation** stories, not just proofs-of-concept.
