> Goal: become comfortable operating in a Windows/AD environment with a C2 framework, not just pass a cert.

## Baseline

- 10+ years: AWS, Linux, infra/ops
- Offensive: eJPT, Amazon Cloud Red Team Professional (Pwnedlabs)

## Gaps I'm closing before CRTO

- Windows + Active Directory offensive tradecraft  
- Initial access and phishing workflows  
- C2 operator basics and OPSEC

## Prep steps

1. **Active Directory & Windows attacks**
   - TryHackMe rooms: `Attacktive Directory`, `Windows PrivEsc`, `Kerberoasting`
   - HackTheBox Windows domain machines

2. **Web foothold skills**
   - TryHackMe Web Pentesting paths, focused on SSRF, SSTI, auth/session issues and API attacks

3. **Operator skills**
   - Lab: basic C2 setup, beacons, staging, redirectors

I'll keep this post updated as I progress and link to detailed lab write-ups.
